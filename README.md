# My Blog

Welcome to My Blog project! This is a microservices-based blogging platform where users can create posts and engage in discussions through comments.

## Features

### 1. Post Creation
Users can create new posts with title, content, and other relevant information. Posts are stored in the database and can be accessed later for viewing or updating.

### 2. Comments
Users can comment on existing posts, adding their thoughts and opinions to the discussion. Comments are associated with specific posts and provide an interactive element to the platform.

### 3. Microservices Architecture
The project follows a microservices architecture, with each feature (post creation, comments) implemented as separate services. This enables better scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in the development process.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for building robust and scalable Java applications.
- **Hibernate:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for managing database interactions.
- **RESTful APIs:** Communication between microservices is achieved through RESTful APIs, ensuring interoperability and ease of integration.
- **Docker:** Containerization technology used to deploy and manage microservices.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestration tool for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend technologies used for creating user interfaces and interactivity.
